                    <br />
                    <p>This feature is useful for when you want to search for specific terms within one or more drug monographs. Instructions below are in three parts: 1) select the drug monograph(s) in which you want to search, 2) define the search limits, and 3) access the search results. <br />
                        <br />
                    <p><b>To select the drug monograph(s) in which you want to search (Part 1)</b>:</p><br /><br />

						<li>In the <b>Enter full or partial text (brand or generic)</b> text box, type the name, or partial name, of the drug monograph you want to search for.<br /><br />
							<b><font color="green">Tip</font></b>: When searching for a drug, you can add an asterisk at the beginning of the characters you type to include search results that contain those typed characters at the beginning, end, or nested within drug names. For example, typing "*aro" will return all drug names (brand and generic) that begin or end with "aro" or contain "aro" nested within the drug name. The asterisk is implied at the end of your typed text so there is no need to include it there.<br /><br />
						<li>Click <b>Search</b><br /><br />

					<p>
					<b>Adding Conditions to Search Terms in Advanced Search</b><br /><br />
					
					When you use Advanced Search, Part 3, you can add conditions to your search by typing different characters or words together with your search terms in the text box. These conditions will apply to a search of the monograph sections you have selected. <br /><br />
					
					Note: these conditions do not apply when using General Search, or Part 1 of Advanced Search. <br /><br />
					
					<b>To search for a term within other words:</b> <br /><br />
					
					You can add an asterisk (*) at the beginning or end of your search term (or both at the beginning and end) to return more search results (Advanced Search, Part 3). For example: b> <br /><br />
					
					<ul class="normalList">
					
                        <li>*lipid returns words that begin with “lipid”, words  with “lipid” nested within, and the word “lipid” on its own 
                            </li>
                        <br /><br />
                        <li>lipid* returns words that end with “lipid”, words with “lipid” nested within, and the word “lipid” on its own</li>
						<br /><br />
                        <li>*lipid* returns words that begin with “lipid”, words that end with “lipid”,  words with “lipid” nested within, and the word “lipid” on its own  </li>
						<br /><br />
                        <li>Therapeutic Class: searches for therapeutic class as assigned by the manufacturer. Therapeutic classes are included in monograph headers</li>
                        <br/><br/>
						<b>Note</b>: to use the asterisk (*) you must have at least three alphanumeric characters in your search, e.g. ace*. <br/><br/>
						<b>Note</b>: the asterisk (*) is not implied at the end of typed characters (as it is when using the asterisk to search for generic or brand name drugs in General Search) and must be included. <br/><br/> </li>
                        
                    </ul>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>To search for two or more terms:</b> <br/><br/>
					
					Type the word “AND” (without quotation marks) between two or more terms to search for drug monographs that contain all those terms in the same sections. Example: “nausea AND vomiting” searches for selected sections that contain both words. Using AND narrows your search. Note: AND must be in capital letters. <br/><br/>
					
					<b>To search for either of two or more terms:</b> <br/><br/>
					
					Type the word “OR” (without quotation marks) between two or more terms to search for drug monographs that contain one of the searched terms, or both of the terms in the same sections. For example, “nausea OR vomiting” searches selected sections that contain either the word nausea, the word vomiting, or both words. Using OR broadens your search. Note: OR must be in capital letters. <br/><br/>
					
					<b>To add more than one condition to your search:</b> <br/><br/>
					
					You can use two or more of AND, OR, or NOT together in the same search. Use parentheses to ensure that the search maintains your desired relationship between search terms. For example: “nausea NOT vomiting OR fever” returns results with: <br /><br />
					
					<ul class="normalList">
					
                        <li>the word “nausea” but not “vomiting” in one or more of the selected sections
                            </li>
                        <br /><br />
                        <li>the word “fever” in one or more of the selected sections </li>
						<br /><br />
                        <li>the words “nausea and fever”, but not the word “vomiting” in one or more of the selected sections </li>
						<br /><br />
                       
                    </ul>
					
					
					A search for “nausea NOT (vomiting OR fever)” returns results with:<br /><br />
					<ul class="normalList">
					
                        <li>the word “nausea” in one or more of the selected sections, but only if those sections do not contain the words “vomiting” or “fever” 
                            </li>
                        <br /><br />
                        <b>Note</b>: when assessing search results, remember that the conditions you add are only applied within the selected sections of the selected monograph(s). <br /><br />
                        
						<b>Note</b>: the above methods for modifying your searches are known as Boolean logic. AND, OR, and NOT are called Boolean operators, while the asterisk (*) is called a wildcard character. <br /><br />
